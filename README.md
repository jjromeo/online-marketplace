The StandardPromotionsChecker contains basic rules for discounts available, however these can be changed or otherwise replaced entirely.

To do this create a class and extend the Promotional module in it:

```ruby
require_relative 'promotional.rb'
class HolidayPromotionsChecker
  extend Promotional
end
```

Rules can now be added to this class, there are two types of rule, product and price rules. 

####Product rules
Product rules will change attributes of products in basket, and are applied before price rules

To add a product rule, create a method for the rule, and make sure it ends in 'product_rule'. These rules should edit the items in the basket attribute of the checker.

```ruby
class HolidayPromotionsChecker
  extend Promotional
  class << self
    def some_new_product_rule
      if condition
      #code which alters basket items
      end
    end
  end
end
```

####Price rules

Price rules will simply change the total price, they are applied after the product rules. 

To add a price rule, create a method which ends in 'price_rule'. Price rules must change the self.amount property.

```ruby
class HolidayPromotionsChecker
extend Promotional
  class << self
      def some_new_price_rule
          if condition
            #code which returns edits self.amount
          end
      end
  end
end
```

Once custom rules are set, a checkout can be initialized using your rule set, and rules will be automatically applied to the basket when total is called.

```ruby
holiday_checkout = Checkout.new(HolidayPromotionsChecker)
holiday_checkout.scan(gloves)
holiday_checkout.scan(wooley_hat)
holiday_checkout.scan(scarf)
holiday_checkout.total # will return the cost after discounts
```
    
Products must be created like those in interface.rb eg: 

```ruby    
gloves = Product.new(code: '001', name: 'Wooley gloves', price: 'Â£10.95')
```
